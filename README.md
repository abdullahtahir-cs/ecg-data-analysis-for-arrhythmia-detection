# EDA Analysis of ECG Signals to Detect Arrhythmia
I have implemented the following data science methods to analyze the data:
1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing.
2. Dimensionality Reduction.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
4. Data Visualization.

# Technologies
1. Python.
2. Jupyter Notebook.
3. PostgreSQL.

# How To Run
1. Install and configure python.
2. You can run .ipynb file on VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Google Collab etc.
3. You have to install the dataset first from this link https://physionet.org/content/ecg-arrhythmia/1.0.0/.
4. Once the dataset is installed, put this **code** & **record"" file in the folder where dataset is.
5. Now, you can run the code.
